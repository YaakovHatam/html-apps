# JS project
practice :)

## The project
A page for drivers that want to build a trip based on the addresses. you should bring all the data placed in `data` folder to the view and have the ability to add new addresses. 

## How to plan my code
You should use only Dynamic JS and your `index.html` should stay with empty body (Except for the JS files).
